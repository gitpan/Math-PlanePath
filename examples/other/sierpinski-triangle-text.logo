; Usage: ucblogo sierpinski-triangle-text.logo
;
; Print the Sierpinski triangle pattern in text with spaces and stars,
; using BITAND to decide whether to plot at a given X,Y or not.
;
; :limit determines the padding at the left, and within that limit the
; range of :y to print is arbitrary.
; Print rows of the triangle from 0 to :limit inclusive.

make "limit 15
for [y 0 :limit] [
  for [x -:limit :y] [
    type ifelse (and :y+:x >= 0                ; blank left of triangle
                     (remainder :y+:x 2) = 0   ; only "even" squares
                     (bitand :y+:x :y-:x) = 0  ; Sierpinski bit test
                ) ["*] ["| |]                  ; star or space
