# This spot of code prints sequence A068608 of Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia
# of Integer Sequences
#
#     http://oeis.org/A068608
#
# which is the infinite knight's tour path of Math::PlanePath::KnightSpiral
# with the X,Y positions numbered according to the SquareSpiral and thus
# giving an integer sequence
#
#     1, 10, 3, 16, 19, 22, 9, 12, 15, 18, 7, 24, 11, 14, ...
#
# All points in the first quadrant are reached by both paths, so this is a
# permutation of the integers.
#
# There's eight variations on the sequence.  2 directions clockwise and
# anti-clockwise and 4 sides to start from relative to the side the square
# spiral numbering starts from.
