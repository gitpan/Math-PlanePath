# Usage: perl hilbert-lines.pl
#
# This is a bit of fun printing the HilbertCurve path in ascii.  It follows
# the terminal width if you've got Term::Size, otherwise 79x23.
#
# Enough of the curve is drawn to fill the whole output size, clipped when
# the path goes outside the output bounds.  You could instead stop at say
#
#     $n_hi = 2**6;
#
# to see just a square portion of the curve.
#
# The $scale variable spaces out the points.  3 apart is good, or tighten it
# up to 2 to fit more on the screen.
#
# The output has Y increasing down the screen.  Taking the Y's in reverse
# order in the final output (ie. $height-1 down to 0) would show it going up
# the screen.
#
