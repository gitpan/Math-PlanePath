=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::DiamondSpiral -- integer points around a diamond shaped spiral

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::DiamondSpiral;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::DiamondSpiral->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path makes a diamond shaped spiral.

This is not simply the C<SquareSpiral> rotated, it spirals around faster,
with side lengths following a pattern 1,1,1,1, 2,2,2,2, 3,3,3,3, etc, if the
flat kink at the bottom (like N=13 to N=14) is treated as part of the lower
right diagonal.

Going diagonally on the sides as done here is like cutting the corners of
the C<SquareSpiral>, which is how it gets around in fewer steps than the
C<SquareSpiral>.  See C<PentSpiralSkewed>, C<HexSpiralSkewed> and
C<HeptSpiralSkewed> for similar cutting just 3, 2 or 1 of the corners.

X<Centred square numbers>N=1,5,13,25,etc on the Y negative axis is the
"centred square numbers" 2*k*(k+1)+1.

=head2 N Start

The default is to number points starting N=1 as shown above.  An optional
C<n_start> can give a different start, with the same shape etc.  For example
to start at 0,

                         24--25 

X<Hexagonal numbers>N=0,1,6,15,28,etc on the X axis is the hexagonal numbers
k*(2k-1).  N=0,3,10,21,36,etc on the negative X axis is the hexagonal
numbers of the "second kind" k*(2k-1) for kE<lt>0.  Combining those two is
the triangular numbers 0,1,3,6,10,15,21,etc, k*(k+1)/2, on the X axis
alternately positive and negative.

X<Square numbers>N=0,2,8,18,etc on the Y axis is 2*squares, 2*Y^2.
N=0,4,12,24,etc on the negative Y axis is X<Pronic numbers>2*pronic,
2*Y*(Y+1).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::DiamondSpiral-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::DiamondSpiral-E<gt>new (n_start =E<gt> $n)>

Create and return a new diamond spiral object.

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.

For C<$n < 1> the return is an empty list, it being considered the path
starts at 1.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>xy_to_n ($x,$y)>

Return the point number for coordinates C<$x,$y>.  C<$x> and C<$y> are
each rounded to the nearest integer, which has the effect of treating each
point in the path as a square of side 1, so the entire plane is covered.

=item C<($n_lo, $n_hi) = $path-E<gt>rect_to_n_range ($x1,$y1, $x2,$y2)>

The returned range is exact, meaning C<$n_lo> and C<$n_hi> are the smallest
and biggest in the rectangle.

=head1 FORMULAS

=head2 Rectangle to N Range

Within each row N increases as X moves away from the Y axis, and within each
column similarly N increases as Y moves away from the X axis.  So in a
rectangle the maximum N is at one of the four corners.

              |
    x1,y2 M---|----M x2,y2
          |   |    |
       -------O---------
          |   |    |
          |   |    |
    x1,y1 M---|----M x1,y1
              |

For any two columns x1 and x2 with x1E<lt>x2, the values in column x2 are
all bigger if x2E<gt>-x1.  This is so even when x1 and x2 are on the same
side of the origin, ie. both positive or both negative.

For any two rows y1 and y2, the values in the part of the row with XE<gt>0
are bigger if y2E<gt>=-y1, and in the part of the row with XE<lt>=0 it's
y2E<gt>-y1, or equivalently y2E<gt>=-y1+1.  So the biggest corner is at

    max_x = (x2 > -x1             ? x2 : x1)
    max_y = (y2 >= -y1+(max_x<=0) ? y2 : y1)

The minimum is similar but a little simpler.  In any column the minimum is
at Y=0, and in any row the minimum is at X=0.  So at 0,0 if that's in the
rectangle, or the edge on the side nearest the origin when not.

    min_x = / if x2 < 0 then x2
            | if x1 > 0 then x1
            \ else           0

    min_y = / if y2 < 0 then y2
            | if y1 > 0 then y1
            \ else           0
