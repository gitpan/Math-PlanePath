Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree -- rationals by tree

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree->new (tree_type => 'SB');
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path enumerates reduced rational fractions X/Y E<gt> 0, ie. X and Y
having no common factor.

The rationals are traversed by rows of a binary tree which represents a
coprime pair X,Y by steps of a subtraction-only greatest common divisor
algorithm which proves them coprime.  Or equivalently by bit runs with
lengths which are the quotients in the division-based Euclidean GCD
algorithm and which are also the terms in the continued fraction
representation of X/Y.

The SB, CW, AYT, HCS, Bird and Drib trees all have the same set of X/Y
rationals in a row, but in a different order due to different encodings of
the N value.  See the author's mathematical write-up for a proof that these
are the only trees with a fixed set of matrices.

The bit runs mean that N values are quite large for relatively modest sized
rationals.  For example in the SB tree 167/3 is N=288230376151711741, a
58-bit number.  The tendency is for the tree to make excursions out to large
rationals while only slowly filling in small ones.  The worst is the integer
X/1 for which N has X many bits, and similarly 1/Y is Y bits.

See F<examples/rationals-tree.pl> in the Math-PlanePath sources for a
printout of all the trees.

Within a row the fractions increase in value.  Each row of the tree is a
repeat of the previous row as first X/(X+Y) and then (X+Y)/Y.  For example

    depth=1    1/2, 2/1

    depth=2    1/3, 2/3    X/(X+Y) of previous row
               3/2, 3/1    (X+Y)/Y of previous row

Plotting the N values by X,Y is as follows.  The unused X,Y positions are
where X and Y have a common factor.  For example X=6,Y=2 has common factor 2
so is never reached.

The X=1 vertical is the fractions 1/Y which is at the left of each tree row,
at N value

    Nstart = 2^depth

The Y=1 horizontal is the X/1 integers at the end each row which is

    Nend = 2^(depth+1)-1

Numbering nodes of the tree by rows starting from 1 means N without the high
1 bit is the offset into the row.  For example binary N="1011" is "011"=3
into the row.  Those bits after the high 1 are also the directions to follow
down the tree to a node, with 0=left and 1=right.  So N="1011" binary goes
from the root 0=left then twice 1=right to reach X/Y=3/4 at N=11 decimal.

=head2 Stern-Brocot Mediant

Writing the parents between the children as an "in-order" tree traversal to
a given depth has all values in increasing order (the same as each row
individually is in increasing order).

                    next level (1+3)/(1+2) = 4/3 mediant

New values at the next level of this flattening are a "mediant"
(x1+x2)/(y1+y2) formed from the left and right parent.  So the next level
4/3 shown is left parent 1/1 and right parent 3/2 giving mediant
(1+3)/(1+2)=4/3.  At the left end a preceding 0/1 is imagined.  At the right
end a following 1/0 is imagined, so as to have 1/(depth+1) and (depth+1)/1
at the ends for a total 2^depth many new values.

The turn sequence left or right along the row depth E<gt>= 2 is by a
repeating LRRL pattern, except the first and last are always R.  (See the
author's mathematical write-up for details.)

As noted above, the values within each row are the same as the Stern-Brocot,
but in a different order.

    N=1                             1/1

    N=8 to N=15     1/4  4/3  3/5 5/2  2/5 5/3  3/4 4/1

Going by rows the denominator of one value becomes the numerator of the
next.  So at 4/3 the denominator 3 becomes the numerator of 3/5 to the
right.  These values are Stern's diatomic sequence.

Each row is symmetric in reciprocals, ie. reading from right to left is the
reciprocals of reading left to right.  The numerators read left to right are
the denominators read right to left.

A node descends as

          X/Y
        /     \
    X/(X+Y)  (X+Y)/Y

Taking these formulas in reverse up the tree shows how it relates to a
subtraction-only greatest common divisor.  At a given node the smaller of P
or Q is subtracted from the bigger,

       P/(Q-P)         (P-Q)/P
      /          or        \
    P/Q                    P/Q

Plotting the N values by X,Y is as follows.  The X=1 vertical and Y=1
horizontal are the same as the SB above, but the values in between are
re-ordered.

At each node the left leg is S<X/(X+Y) E<lt> 1> and the right leg is
S<(X+Y)/Y E<gt> 1>, which means N is even above the X=Y diagonal and odd
below.  In general each right leg increments the integer part of the
fraction,

    X/Y                       right leg each time
    (X+Y)/Y   = 1 + X/Y
    (X+2Y)/Y  = 2 + X/Y
    (X+3Y)/Y  = 3 + X/Y
    etc

This means the integer part is the trailing 1-bits of N,

    floor(X/Y) = count trailing 1-bits of N
    eg. 7/2 is at N=23 binary "10111"
        which has 3 trailing 1-bits for floor(7/2)=3

N values for the SB and CW trees are converted by reversing bits except the
highest.  So at a given X,Y position

    SB  N = 1abcde         SB <-> CW by reversing bits
    CW  N = 1edcba         except the high 1-bit

For example at X=3,Y=4 the SB tree has N=11 = "1011" binary and the CW has
N=14 binary "1110", a reversal of the bits below the high 1.

N to X/Y in the CW tree can be calculated keeping track of just an X,Y pair
and descending to X/(X+Y) or (X+Y)/Y using the bits of N from high to low.
The relationship between the SB and CW N's means the same can be used to
calculate the SB tree by taking the bits of N from low to high instead.

See also L<Math::PlanePath::ChanTree> for a generalization of CW to ternary
or higher trees, ie. descending to 3 or more children at each node.

Their constructions are a one-to-one mapping between integer N and rational
X/Y as a way of enumerating the rationals.  This is not designed to be a
tree as such, but the result is the same 2^level rows as the above trees.
The X/Y values within each row are the same, but in a different order.

    N=1                             1/1
                              ------   ------

    N=8 to N=15     4/1  1/4  4/3 3/4  5/2 2/5  5/3 3/5

Each fraction descends as follows.  The left is an increment and the right
is reciprocal of the increment.

            X/Y
          /     \
    X/Y + 1     1/(X/Y + 1)

which means

          X/Y
        /     \
    (X+Y)/Y  Y/(X+Y)

The left leg (X+Y)/Y is the same the CW has on its right leg.  But Y/(X+Y)
is not the same as the CW (the other there being X/(X+Y)).

The left leg increments the integer part, so the integer part is given by
(in a fashion similar to CW 1-bits above)

    floor(X/Y) = count trailing 0-bits of N
                 plus one extra if N=2^k

N=2^k is one extra because its trailing 0-bits started from N=1 where
floor(1/1)=1 whereas any other odd N starts from some floor(X/Y)=0.

X<Fibonacci numbers>The Y/(X+Y) right leg forms the Fibonacci numbers
F(k)/F(k+1) at the end of each row, ie. at Nend=2^(level+1)-1.  And as noted
by Andreev, successive right leg fractions N=4k+1 and N=4k+3 add up to 1,

    X/Y at N=4k+1  +  X/Y at N=4k+3  =  1
    Eg. 2/5 at N=13 and 3/5 at N=15 add up to 1

Plotting the N values by X,Y gives

N=1,2,4,8,etc on the Y=1 horizontal is the X/1 integers at
Nstart=2^level=2^X.  N=1,3,5,9,etc in the X=1 vertical is the 1/Y
fractions.  Those fractions always immediately follow the
corresponding integer, so N=Nstart+1=2^(Y-1)+1 in that column.

In each node the left leg (X+Y)/Y E<gt> 1 and the right leg Y/(X+Y) E<lt> 1,
which means odd N is above the X=Y diagonal and even N is below.

X<Kepler, Johannes>The tree structure corresponds to Johannes Kepler's tree
of fractions (see L<Math::PlanePath::FractionsTree>).  That tree starts from
1/2 and makes fractions A/B with AE<lt>B by descending to A/(A+B) and
B/(A+B).  Those descents are the same as the AYT tree and the two are
related simply by

    A = Y        AYT denominator is Kepler numerator
    B = X+Y      AYT sum num+den is the Kepler denominator

This arises also in a radix=1 variation of Jeffrey Shallit's digit-based
continued fraction encoding.  See L<Math::PlanePath::CfracDigits/Radix 1>.

If the continued fraction of X/Y is

                 1
    X/Y = a + ------------             a >= 0
                     1
              b + -----------         b,c,etc >= 1

                  c + -------
                    ... +  1
                          ---          z >= 2
                           z

then the N value is bit runs of lengths a,b,c etc.

    N = 1000 1000 1000 ... 1000
        \--/ \--/ \--/     \--/
         a+1   b    c       z-1

Each group is 1 or more bits.  The +1 in "a+1" makes the first group 1 or
more bits, since a=0 occurs for any X/YE<lt>=1.  The -1 in "z-1" makes the
last group 1 or more since zE<gt>=2.

    N=1                             1/1
                              ------   ------
    N=2 to N=3             2/1               1/2

    N=4 to N=7         3/1      3/2      1/3      2/3

    N=8 to N=15      4/1 5/2  4/3 5/3  1/4 2/5  3/4 3/5

The result is a bit reversal of the N values in the AYT tree.

    AYT  N = binary "1abcde"      AYT <-> HCS bit reversal
    HCS  N = binary "1edcba"

For example at X=4,Y=7 the AYT tree is N=11 binary "10111" whereas HCS there
has N=30 binary "11110", a reversal of the bits below the high 1.

Notice that unlike the other trees N=1,2,5,10,etc in the X=1 vertical for
fractions 1/Y is not the row start or end, but instead are on a zigzag
through the middle of the tree binary N=1010...etc alternate 1 and 0 bits.
The integers X/1 in the Y=1 vertical are similar, but N=11010...etc starting
the alternation from a 1 in the second highest bit, since those integers are
in the right hand half of the tree.

The Bird tree N values are related to the SB tree by inverting every second
bit starting from the second after the high 1-bit,

    Bird N=1abcdefg..    binary
             101010..    xor, so b,d,f etc flip 0<->1
    SB   N=1aBcDeFg..         to make B,D,F

For example 3/4 in the SB tree is at N=11 = binary 1011.  Xor with 0010 for
binary 1001 N=9 which is 3/4 in the Bird tree.  The same xor goes back the
other way Bird tree to SB tree.

This xoring is a mirroring in the tree, swapping left and right at each
level.  Only every second bit is inverted because mirroring twice puts it
back to the ordinary way on even rows.

procedure described above which relates BirdE<lt>-E<gt>SB applies to
DribE<lt>-E<gt>CW, but working from the second lowest bit upwards, ie. xor

=head2 Common Characteristics

The SB, CW, Bird, Drib, AYT and HCS trees have the same set of rationals in
each row, just in different orders.  The properties of Stern's diatomic
sequence mean that within a row the totals are

    row N=2^depth to N=2^(depth+1)-1 inclusive

      sum X/Y     = (3 * 2^depth - 1) / 2
      sum X       = 3^depth
      sum 1/(X*Y) = 1

For example the SB tree depth=2, N=4 to N=7,

    sum X/Y     = 1/3 + 2/3 + 3/2 + 3/1 = 11/2 = (3*2^2-1)/2
    sum X       = 1+2+3+3 = 9 = 3^2
    sum 1/(X*Y) = 1/(1*3) + 1/(2*3) + 1/(3*2) + 1/(3*1) = 1

Many permutations are conceivable within a row, but the ones here have some
relationship to X/Y descendants, tree sub-forms or continued fractions.  As
an encoding of continued fraction terms by bit runs the combinations are

     bit encoding           high to low    low to high
    ----------------        -----------    -----------
    0000 1111 runs              SB             CW
    0101 1010 alternating       Bird           Drib
    1000 1000 runs              HCS            AYT

A run of alternating 101010 ends where the next bit is the oppose of the
expected alternating 0,1.  This is a doubled bit 00 or 11.  An electrical
engineer would think of it as a phase shift.

then the question mark function "?(r)" is

                     1           1           1
    ?(r) = 2 * (1 - ---- * (1 - ---- * (1 - ---- * (1 - ...
                    2^q0        2^q1        2^q2

                     1         1            1
         = 2 * (1 - ---- + --------- - ------------ + ... )
                    2^q0   2^(q0+q1)   2^(q0+q1+q2)

For rational r the continued fraction q0,q1,q2,etc is finite and so the ?(r)
sum is finite and rational.  The pattern of + and - in the terms gives runs
of bits the same as the N values in the Stern-Brocot tree.  The
RationalsTree code can calculate the ?(r) function by

    rational r=X/Y
    N = xy_to_n(X,Y) tree_type=>"SB"
    depth = floor(log2(N))       # row containing N (depth=0 at top)
    Ndepth = 2^depth             # start of row containing N

           2*(N-Ndepth) + 1
    ?(r) = ----------------
                Ndepth

The effect of N-Ndepth is to remove the high 1-bit, leaving an offset into
the row.  2*(..)+1 appends an extra 1-bit at the end.  The division by
Ndepth scales down from integer N to a fraction.

    N    = 1abcdef      integer, in binary
    ?(r) = a.bcdef1     binary fraction

For example ?(2/3) is X=2,Y=3 which is N=5 in the SB tree.  It is at
depth=2, Ndepth=2^2=4, and so ?(2/3)=(2*(5-4)+1)/4=3/4.  Or written in
binary N=101 gives Ndepth=100 and N-Ndepth=01 so 2*(N-Ndepth)+1=011 and
divide by Ndepth=100 for ?=0.11.

In practice this is not a very efficient way to handle the question
function, since the bit runs in the N values may become quite large for
relatively modest fractions.  (L<Math::ContinuedFraction> may be better, and
also allows repeating terms from quadratic irrationals to be represented
exactly.)

=head2 Pythagorean Triples

Pythagorean triples A^2+B^2=C^2 can be generated by A=P^2-Q^2, B=2*P*Q.  If
PE<gt>QE<gt>1 with P,Q no common factor and one odd the other even then this
gives all primitive triples, being primitive in the sense of A,B,C no common
factor (L<Math::PlanePath::PythagoreanTree/PQ Coordinates>).

In the Calkin-Wilf tree the parity of X,Y pairs are as follows.  Pairs X,Y
with one odd the other even are N=0 or 2 mod 3.

    CW tree           X/Y
                   --------
    N=0 mod 3      even/odd
    N=1 mod 3      odd/odd
    N=2 mod 3      odd/even

This occurs because the numerators are the Stern diatomic sequence and the
denominators likewise but offset by 1.  The Stern diatomic sequence is a
repeating pattern even,odd,odd (eg. per L<Math::NumSeq::SternDiatomic/Odd
and Even>).

The XE<gt>Y pairs in the CW tree are the right leg of each node, which is N
odd.  so

    CW tree N=3 or 5 mod 6   gives X>Y one odd the other even

    index t=1,2,3,etc to enumerate such pairs
    N = 3*t   if t odd
        3*t-1 if t even

X<Jacobsthal numbers>2 of each 6 points are used.  In a given row it's
width/3 but rounded up or down according to where the 3,5mod6 falls on the
N=2^depth start, which is either floor or ceil according to depth odd or
even,

    NumPQ(depth) = floor(2^depth / 3) for depth=even
                   ceil (2^depth / 3) for depth=odd
      = 0, 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171, 341, ...

These are the Jacobsthal numbers, which in binary are 101010...101 and
1010...1011.

For the other tree types the various bit transformations which map N
positions between the trees can be applied to the above N=3or5 mod 6.  The
simplest is the L tree where the N offset and row reversal gives N=0or4
mod 6.

The SB tree is a bit reversal of the CW, as described above, and for the
Pythagorean N this gives

    SB tree N=0 or 2 mod 2 and N="11...." in binary
     gives X>Y one odd the other even

N="11..." binary is the bit reversal of the CW N=odd "1...1" condition.
This bit pattern is those N in the second half of each row, which is where
the X/Y E<gt> 1 rationals occur.  The N=0or2 mod 3 condition is unchanged by
the bit reversal.  N=0or2 mod 3 precisely when bitreverse(N)=0or2 mod 3.

For SB whether it's odd/even or even/odd at N=0or2 mod 3 alternates between
rows.  The two are both wanted, they just happen to switch in each row.

    SB tree X/Y    depth=even     depth=odd
                   ----------     ---------
    N=0 mod 3      odd/even       even/odd
    N=1 mod 3      odd/odd        odd/odd    <- exclude for Pythagorean
    N=2 mod 3      even/odd       odd/even

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::RationalsTree-E<gt>new (tree_type =E<gt> $str)>

Create and return a new path object.  C<tree_type> (a string) can be

    "SB"      Stern-Brocot
    "CW"      Calkin-Wilf
    "AYT"     Yu-Ting, Andreev
    "HCS"
    "Bird"
    "Drib"
    "L"

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>n_start()>

Return the first N in the path.  This is 1 for SB, CW, AYT, HCS, Bird and
Drib, but 0 for L.

=item C<($n_lo, $n_hi) = $path-E<gt>rect_to_n_range ($x1,$y1, $x2,$y2)>

Return a range of N values which occur in a rectangle with corners at
C<$x1>,C<$y1> and C<$x2>,C<$y2>.  The range is inclusive.

For reference, C<$n_hi> can be quite large because within each row there's
only one new X/1 integer and 1/Y fraction.  So if X=1 or Y=1 is included
then roughly C<$n_hi = 2**max(x,y)>.  If min(x,y) is bigger than 1 then it
reduces a little to roughly 2**(max/min + min).

=back

=head2 Tree Methods

X<Complete binary tree>Each point has 2 children, so the path is a complete
binary tree.

=over

=item C<@n_children = $path-E<gt>tree_n_children($n)>

Return the two children of C<$n>, or an empty list if C<$n E<lt> 1>
(ie. before the start of the path).

This is simply C<2*$n, 2*$n+1>.  Written in binary the children are C<$n>
with an extra bit appended, a 0-bit or a 1-bit.

=item C<$num = $path-E<gt>tree_n_num_children($n)>

Return 2, since every node has two children.  If C<$nE<lt>1>, ie. before the
start of the path, then return C<undef>.

=item C<$n_parent = $path-E<gt>tree_n_parent($n)>

Return the parent node of C<$n>.  Or return C<undef> if C<$n E<lt>= 1> (the
top of the tree).

This is simply Nparent = floor(N/2), ie. strip the least significant bit
from C<$n>.  (Undo what C<tree_n_children()> appends.)

=item C<$depth = $path-E<gt>tree_n_to_depth($n)>

Return the depth of node C<$n>, or C<undef> if there's no point C<$n>.  The
top of the tree at N=1 is depth=0, then its children depth=1, etc.

This is simply floor(log2(N)) since the tree has 2 nodes per point.  For
example N=4 through N=7 are all depth=2.

The L tree starts at N=0 and the calculation becomes floor(log2(N+1)) there.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>tree_depth_to_n($depth)>

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>tree_depth_to_n_end($depth)>

Return the first or last N at tree level C<$depth> in the path, or C<undef>
if nothing at that depth or not a tree.  The top of the tree is depth=0.

The structure of the tree means the first N is at C<2**$depth>, or for the L
tree S<C<2**$depth - 1>>.  The last N is C<2**($depth+1)-1>, or for the L
tree C<2**($depth+1)>.

=back

=head2 Tree Descriptive Methods

=over

=item C<$num = $path-E<gt>tree_num_children_minimum()>

=item C<$num = $path-E<gt>tree_num_children_maximum()>

Return 2 since every node has 2 children so that's both the minimum and
maximum.

=item C<$bool = $path-E<gt>tree_any_leaf()>

Return false, since there are no leaf nodes in the tree.
