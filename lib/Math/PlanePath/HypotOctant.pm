=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::HypotOctant -- octant of points in order of hypotenuse distance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::HypotOctant;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::HypotOctant->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path visits an octant of integer points X,Y in order of their distance
from the origin 0,0.  The points are a rising triangle 0E<lt>=YE<lt>=X,

For example N=11 at X=4,Y=1 is sqrt(4*4+1*1) = sqrt(17) from the origin.
The next furthest from the origin is X=3,Y=3 at sqrt(18).

This octant is "primitive" elements X^2+Y^2 in the sense that it excludes
negative X or Y or swapped Y,X.

=head2 Equal Distances

Points with the same distance from the origin are taken in anti-clockwise
order from the X axis, which means by increasing Y.  Points with the same
distance occur when there's more than one way to express a given distance as
the sum of two squares.

Pythagorean triples give a point on the X axis and also above.  For example
5^2 == 4^2 + 3^2 has N=14 at X=5,Y=0 simply as 5^2 = 5^2 + 0 and then N=15
at X=4,Y=3 for the triple.  Both are 5 away from the origin.

Combinations like 20^2 + 15^2 == 24^2 + 7^2 occur too, and also with three
or more different ways to have the same sum distance.

=head2 Even Points

Option C<points =E<gt> "even"> visits just the even points, meaning the sum
X+Y even, so X,Y both even or both odd.

Even points can be mapped to all points by a 45 degree rotate and flip.
N=1,3,6,12,etc on the X axis here is on the X=Y diagonal of all-points.  And
conversely N=1,2,4,7,10,etc on the X=Y diagonal here is on the X axis of
all-points.

    all_X = (even_X + even_Y) / 2
    all_Y = (even_X - even_Y) / 2

    even_X = (all_X + all_Y)
    even_Y = (all_X - all_Y)

The sets of points with equal hypotenuse are the same in the even and all,
but the flip takes them in reverse order.  The first such reversal occurs at
N=14 and N=15.  In even-points they're at 7,1 and 5,5.  In all-points
they're at 5,0 and 4,3 and those two map 5,5 and 7,1, ie. the opposite way
around.

=head2 Odd Points

Option C<points =E<gt> "odd"> visits just the odd points, meaning sum X+Y
odd, so X,Y one odd the other even.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::HypotOctant-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::HypotOctant-E<gt>new (points =E<gt> $str)>

Create and return a new hypot octant path object.  The C<points> option can be

    "all"         all integer X,Y (the default)
    "even"        only points with X+Y even
    "odd"         only points with X+Y odd

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.

For C<$n E<lt> 1> the return is an empty list, it being considered the first
point at X=0,Y=0 is N=1.

Currently it's unspecified what happens if C<$n> is not an integer.
Successive points are a fair way apart, so it may not make much sense to
give an X,Y position in between the integer C<$n>.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>xy_to_n ($x,$y)>

Return an integer point number for coordinates C<$x,$y>.  Each integer N is
considered the centre of a unit square and an C<$x,$y> within that square
returns N.

=back

=head1 FORMULAS

The calculations are not very efficient currently.  For each Y row a current
X and the corresponding hypotenuse X^2+Y^2 are maintained.  To find the next
furthest a search through those hypotenuses is made seeking the smallest,
including equal smallest, which then become the next N points.

For C<n_to_xy()> an array is built in the object used for repeat
calculations.  For C<xy_to_n()> an array of hypot to N gives a the first N
of given X^2+Y^2 distance.  A search is then made through the next few N for
the case there's more than one X,Y of that hypot.

=head1 OEIS

      A024509   X^2+Y^2 of all points not on X axis
                  being integers occurring as sum of two non-zero squares,
                  with repetitions for multiple ways

    points="even"
      A036702   N on X=Y leading Diagonal
                  being count of points norm<=k

    points="odd"
      A057653   X^2+Y^2 values occurring
                  ie. odd numbers which are sum of two squares,
                  without repetitions
