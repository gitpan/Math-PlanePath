=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::FractionsTree -- fractions by tree

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::FractionsTree;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::FractionsTree->new (tree_type => 'Kepler');
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path enumerates fractions X/Y in the range 0 E<lt> X/Y E<lt> 1 and in
reduced form, ie. X and Y having no common factor, using a method by
Johannes Kepler.

Fractions are traversed by rows of a binary tree which effectively
represents a coprime pair X,Y by subtraction steps of a subtraction-only
form of Euclid's greatest common divisor algorithm which would prove X,Y
coprime.  The steps left or right are encoded/decoded as an N value.

=head2 Kepler Tree

X<Kepler, Johannes>The default and only tree currently is by Johannes Kepler.

    "Harmonices Mundi", Book III
    Excerpt of translation by Aiton, Duncan and Field at
    http://ndirty.cute.fi/~karttu/Kepler/a086592.htm

In principle similar bit reversal etc variations as in C<RationalsTree>
would be possible.

    N=1                             1/2
                              ------   ------
    N=2 to N=3             1/3               2/3
                          /    \            /   \
    N=4 to N=7         1/4      3/4      2/5      3/5
                       | |      | |      | |      | |
    N=8 to N=15     1/5  4/5  3/7 4/7  2/7 5/7  3/8 5/8

A node descends as

          X/Y
        /     \
    X/(X+Y)  Y/(X+Y)

Kepler described the tree as starting at 1, ie. 1/1, which descends to two
identical 1/2 and 1/2.  For the code here a single copy starting from 1/2 is
used.

Plotting the N values by X,Y is as follows.  Since it's only fractions
X/YE<lt>1, ie. XE<lt>Y, all points are above the X=Y diagonal.  The unused
X,Y positions are where X and Y have a common factor.  For example X=2,Y=6
have common factor 2 so is never reached.

The X=1 vertical is the fractions 1/Y at the left end of each tree row,
which is

    Nstart=2^level

The diagonal X=Y-1, fraction K/(K+1), is the second in each row, at
N=Nstart+1.  That's the maximum X/Y in each level.

The N values in the upper octant, ie. above the line Y=2*X, are even and
those below that line are odd.  This arises since XE<lt>Y so the left leg
X/(X+Y) E<lt> 1/2 and the right leg Y/(X+Y) E<gt> 1/2.  The left is an even
N and the right an odd N.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::FractionsTree-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new path object.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>n_start()>

Return 1, the first N in the path.

=item C<($n_lo, $n_hi) = $path-E<gt>rect_to_n_range ($x1,$y1, $x2,$y2)>

Return a range of N values which occur in a rectangle with corners at
C<$x1>,C<$y1> and C<$x2>,C<$y2>.  The range is inclusive.

For reference, C<$n_hi> can be quite large because within each row there's
only one new 1/Y fraction.  So if X=1 is included then roughly C<$n_hi =
2**max(x,y)>.

=back

=head2 Tree Methods

X<Complete binary tree>Each point has 2 children, so the path is a complete
binary tree.

=over

=item C<@n_children = $path-E<gt>tree_n_children($n)>

Return the two children of C<$n>, or an empty list if C<$n E<lt> 1>
(before the start of the path).

This is simply C<2*$n, 2*$n+1>.  The children are C<$n> with an extra bit
appended, either a 0-bit or a 1-bit.

=item C<$num = $path-E<gt>tree_n_num_children($n)>

Return 2, since every node has two children, or return C<undef> if
C<$nE<lt>1> (before the start of the path).

=item C<$n_parent = $path-E<gt>tree_n_parent($n)>

Return the parent node of C<$n>, or C<undef> if C<$n E<lt>= 1> (the top of
the tree).

This is simply C<floor($n/2)>, stripping the least significant bit from
C<$n> (undoing what C<tree_n_children()> appends).

=item C<$depth = $path-E<gt>tree_n_to_depth($n)>

Return the depth of node C<$n>, or C<undef> if there's no point C<$n>.  The
top of the tree at N=1 is depth=0, then its children depth=1, etc.

The structure of the tree with 2 nodes per point means the depth is simply
floor(log2(N)), so for example N=4 through N=7 are all depth=2.

=back

=head2 Tree Descriptive Methods

=over

=item C<$num = $path-E<gt>tree_num_children_minimum()>

=item C<$num = $path-E<gt>tree_num_children_maximum()>

Return 2 since every node has 2 children, making that both the minimum and
maximum.

=item C<$bool = $path-E<gt>tree_any_leaf()>

Return false, since there are no leaf nodes in the tree.

=back

=head1 OEIS

The trees are in Sloane's Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences in the
following forms

    http://oeis.org/A020651   (etc)

    tree_type=Kepler
      A020651  - X numerator (RationalsTree AYT denominators)
      A086592  - Y denominators
      A086593  - X+Y sum, and every second denominator
      A020650  - Y-X difference (RationalsTree AYT numerators)

The tree descends as X/(X+Y) and Y/(X+Y) so the denominators are two copies
of X+Y time after the initial 1/2.  A086593 is every second, starting at 2,
eliminating the duplication.  This is also the sum X+Y, from value 3
onwards, as can be seen by thinking of writing a node as the X+Y which would
be the denominators it descends to.
