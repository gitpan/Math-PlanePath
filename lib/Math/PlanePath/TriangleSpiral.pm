=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::TriangleSpiral -- integer points drawn around an equilateral triangle

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::TriangleSpiral;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::TriangleSpiral->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path makes a spiral shaped as an equilateral triangle (each side the
same length).

Cells are spread horizontally to fit on a square grid as per
L<Math::PlanePath/Triangular Lattice>.  The horizontal gaps are 2, so for
instance n=1 is at x=0,y=0 then n=2 is at x=2,y=0.  The diagonals are 1
across and 1 up or down, so n=3 is at x=1,y=1.  Each alternate row is offset
from the one above or below.

This grid is the same as the HexSpiral and the path is like that spiral
except instead of a flat top and SE,SW sides it extends to triangular peaks.
The result is a longer loop and each successive loop is step=9 longer than
the previous (whereas the HexSpiral is step=6 more).

The triangular numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36 etc, k*(k+1)/2, fall one
before the successive corners of the triangle, so when plotted make three
lines going vertically and angled down left and right.

The 11-gonal "hendecagonal" numbers 11, 30, 58, etc, k*(9k-7)/2 fall on a
straight line horizontally to the right.  (As per the general rule that a
step "s" lines up the (s+2)-gonal numbers.)

=head2 N Start

The default is to number points starting N=1 as shown above.  An optional
C<n_start> can give a different start with the same shape etc.  For example
to start at 0,

    n_start => 0      15

                   16    14
                  /        \     
                17     3    13   
               /     /  \     \  
             18     4     2    12   ...  
            /     /        \     \     \ 
          19     5     0-----1    11    30 
         /     /                    \     \ 
       20     6-----7-----8-----9----10    29 
      /                                      \ 
    21----22----23----24----25----26----27----28 

With this adjustment the X axis N=0,1,11,30,etc is the hendecagonal numbers
(9k-7)*k/2.  And N=0,8,25,etc diagonally South-East is the hendecagonals of
the second kind which is (9k-7)*k/2 for k negative.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::TriangleSpiral-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::TriangleSpiral-E<gt>new (n_start =E<gt> $n)>

Create and return a new triangle spiral object.

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.

For C<$n < 1> the return is an empty list, it being considered the path
starts at 1.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>xy_to_n ($x,$y)>

Return the point number for coordinates C<$x,$y>.  C<$x> and C<$y> are
each rounded to the nearest integer, which has the effect of treating each
C<$n> in the path as a square of side 1.

Only every second square in the plane has an N.  If C<$x,$y> is a
position without an N then the return is C<undef>.
