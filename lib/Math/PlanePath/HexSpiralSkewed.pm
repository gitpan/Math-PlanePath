=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::HexSpiralSkewed -- integer points around a skewed hexagonal spiral

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::HexSpiralSkewed;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::HexSpiralSkewed->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path makes a hexagonal spiral with points skewed so as to fit a square
grid and fully cover the plane.

    13--12--11   ...              2
     |         \   \
    14   4---3  10  23            1
     |   |     \   \   \
    15   5   1---2   9  22    <- Y=0
      \   \          |   | 
        16   6---7---8  21       -1
          \              |    
            17--18--19--20       -2

     ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^ 
    -2  -1  X=0  1   2   3  ...

The kinds of N=3*k^2 numbers which fall on straight lines in the plain
C<HexSpiral> also fall on straight lines when skewed.  See
L<Math::PlanePath::HexSpiral> for notes on this.

=head2 Skew

The skewed path is the same shape as the plain C<HexSpiral>, but fits more
points on a square grid.  The skew pushes the top horizontal to the left, as
shown by the following parts, and the bottom horizontal is similarly skewed
but to the right.

    HexSpiralSkewed               HexSpiral

    13--12--11                   13--12--11       
     |         \                /          \      
    14          10            14            10    
     |             \         /                \  
    15               9     15                   9

    -2  -1  X=0  1   2     -4 -3 -2  X=0  2  3  4

In general the coordinates can be converted each way by

    plain X,Y -> skewed (X-Y)/2, Y

    skewed X,Y -> plain 2*X+Y, Y

=head1 Corners

C<HexSpiralSkewed> is similar to the C<SquareSpiral> but cuts off the
top-right and bottom-left corners so that each loop is 6 steps longer than
the previous, whereas for the C<SquareSpiral> it's 8.  See
L<Math::PlanePath::SquareSpiral/Corners> for other corner cutting.

=head2 Wider

An optional C<wider> parameter makes the path wider, stretched along the top
and bottom horizontals.  For example

    $path = Math::PlanePath::HexSpiralSkewed->new (wider => 2);

gives

    21--20--19--18--17                    2
     |                 \    
    22   8---7---6---5  16                1
     |   |             \   \    
    23   9   1---2---3---4  15        <- Y=0
      \   \                  |     
       24   10--11--12--13--14  ...      -1
          \                      |    
            25--26--27--28--29--30       -2

     ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^ 
    -4  -3  -2  -1  X=0  1   2   3  ...

The centre horizontal from N=1 is extended by C<wider> many further places,
then the path loops around that shape.  The starting point 1 is shifted to
the left by wider/2 places (rounded up to an integer) to keep the spiral
centred on the origin X=0,Y=0.

Each loop is still 6 longer than the previous, since the widening is
basically a constant amount added into each loop.  The result is the same as
the plain C<HexSpiral> of the same widening too.  The effect looks better in
the plain C<HexSpiral>.

=head2 N Start

The default is to number points starting N=1 as shown above.  An optional
C<n_start> can give a different start with the same shape etc.  For example
to start at 0,

=cut

# math-image --path=HexSpiralSkewed,n_start=0 --all --output=numbers --size=70x9

=pod

    n_start => 0

    27  26  25  24                            3
    28  12  11  10  23                        2
    29  13   3   2   9  22                    1
    30  14   4   0   1   8  21 ...       <- Y=0
        31  15   5   6   7  20  39           -1
            32  16  17  18  19  38           -2
                33  34  35  36  37           -3
                 
    -3  -2  -1  X=0  1   2   3   4

In this numbering the X axis N=0,1,8,21,etc is the octagonal numbers
3*X*(X+1).

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::HexSpiralSkewed-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::HexSpiralSkewed-E<gt>new (wider =E<gt> $w)>

Create and return a new hexagon spiral object.  An optional C<wider>
parameter widens the spiral path, it defaults to 0 which is no widening.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>xy_to_n ($x,$y)>

Return the point number for coordinates C<$x,$y>.  C<$x> and C<$y> are
each rounded to the nearest integer, which has the effect of treating each
point in the path as a square of side 1.
