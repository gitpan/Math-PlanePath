X<Square numbers>N=1,4,9,16,etc on the X=Y leading diagonal are the perfect
squares.  N=2,6,12,20,etc at the ends of the other diagonals are the
X<Pronic numbers>pronic numbers k*(k+1).

Incidentally "octant" usually refers to an eighth of a 3-dimensional
coordinate space.  Since C<PlanePath> is only 2 dimensions there's no
confusion and at the risk of abusing nomenclature half a quadrant is
reckoned as an "octant".

=head2 Pyramid Rows

Taking two diagonals running from k^2+1 to (k+1)^2 is the same as a row of
the step=2 C<PyramidRows> (see L<Math::PlanePath::PyramidRows>).  Each
endpoint is the same, but here it's two diagonals instead of one row.  For
example in the C<PyramidRows> the Y=3 row runs from N=10 to N=16 ending at
X=3,Y=3.  Here that's in two diagonals N=10 to N=12 and then N=13 to N=16,
and that N=16 endpoint is the same X=3,Y=3.

=head2 Direction

Option C<direction =E<gt> 'up'> reverses the order within each diagonal and
counts upward from the centre to the Y axis.

In this arrangement N=1,2,4,6,9,etc on the Y axis are alternately the
squares and the pronic numbers.  The squares are on even Y and pronic on
odd Y.

=head2 N Start

The default is to number points starting N=1 as shown above.  An optional
C<n_start> can give a different start, in the same diagonals sequence.  For
example to start at 0,

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::DiagonalsOctant-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::DiagonalsOctant-E<gt>new (direction =E<gt> $str, n_start =E<gt> $n)>

Create and return a new path object.

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.

For C<$n E<lt> 0.5> the return is an empty list, it being considered the
path begins at 1.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>xy_to_n ($x,$y)>

Return the point number for coordinates C<$x,$y>.  C<$x> and C<$y> are
each rounded to the nearest integer, which has the effect of treating each
point C<$n> as a square of side 1.

=item C<($n_lo, $n_hi) = $path-E<gt>rect_to_n_range ($x1,$y1, $x2,$y2)>

The returned range is exact, meaning C<$n_lo> and C<$n_hi> are the smallest
and biggest in the rectangle.

=head1 FORMULAS

=head2 N to X,Y

To break N into X,Y it's convenient to take two diagonals at a time, since
the length then changes by 1 each pair making a quadratic.  Starting at each
X=0,Y=odd just after perfect square N allows just a sqrt.

    Nstart = d*d+1

where d numbers diagonal pairs, eg. d=3 for X=0,Y=5 going down.  This is
easily reversed as

    d = floor sqrt(N-1)

The code reckons the start of the diagonal as 0.5 further back, so that
N=9.5 is at X=-.5,Y=5.5.  To do that d is formed as

    d = floor sqrt(N-0.5)
      = int( sqrt(int(4*$n)-2)/2 )

Taking /2 out of the sqrt helps with C<Math::BigInt> which circa Perl 5.14
doesn't inter-operate with flonums very well.

In any case N-Nstart is an offset into two diagonals, the first of length d
many points and the second d+1.  For example d=3 starting Y=5 for points
N=10,11,12 followed by Y=6 N=13,14,15,16.

The formulas are simplified by calculating a remainder relative to the
second diagonal, so it's negative for the first and positive for the second,

    Nrem = N - (d*(d+1)+1)

d*(d+1)+1 is 1 past the pronic numbers when end each first diagonal, as
described above.  In any case for example d=3 is relative to N=13 making
Nrem=-3,-2,-1 or Nrem=0,1,2,3.

To include the preceding 0.5 in the second diagonal simply means reckoning
NremE<gt>=-0.5 as belonging to the second.  In that base

    if Nrem >= -0.5
      X = Nrem            # direction="down"
      Y = 2*d - Nrem
    else
      X = Nrem + d
      Y = d - Nrem - 1

For example N=15 Nrem=1 is the first case, X=1, Y=2*3-1=5.  Or N=11 Nrem=-2
the second X=-2+3=1, Y=3-(-2)-1=4.

For "up" direction the Nrem and d are the same, but the coordinate
directions reverse.

    if Nrem >= -0.5
      X = d - Nrem        # direction="up"
      Y = d + Nrem
    else
      X = -Nrem - 1
      Y = 2d + Nrem

Another way is to reckon Nstart from the X=0,Y=even diagonals, which is then
two diagonals of the same length and d formed by a sqrt inverting a pronic
Nstart=d*(d+1).

=head2 Rectangle to N Range

Within each row increasing X is increasing N, and in each column increasing
Y is increasing N.  This is so in both "down" and "up" arrangements.  On
that basis in a rectangle the lower left corner is the minimum N and the
upper right is the maximum N.

If the rectangle is partly outside the covered octant then the corners must
be shifted to put them in range, ie. trim off any rows or columns entirely
outside the rectangle.  For the lower left this means,

      |  |    /
      |  |   /
      +--------          if x1 < 0 then x1 = 0
    x1   | /             increase x1 to within octant
         |/
         +

         |  |/
         |  |            if y1 < x1 then y1 = x1
         | /|            increase y1 to bottom-left within octant
         |/ +----y1
         +  x1

And for the top right,

         |    /  x2
         | ------+ y2    if x2 > y2 then x2 = y2
         |  /    |       decrease x2 so top-right within octant
         | /     |         (the end of the y2 row)
         |/
