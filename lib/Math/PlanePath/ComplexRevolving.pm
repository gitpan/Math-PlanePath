=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::ComplexRevolving -- points in revolving complex base i+1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::ComplexRevolving;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::ComplexRevolving->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X<Knuth, Donald>This path traverses points by a complex number base i+1 with
turn factor i (+90 degrees) at each 1 bit.  This is the "revolving binary
representation" of Knuth's Seminumerical Algorithms section 4.1 exercise 28.

          47       18 63       34        -3

The 1 bits in N are exponents e0 to et, in increasing order,

    N = 2^e0 + 2^e1 + ... + 2^et        e0 < e1 < ... < et

and are applied to a base b=i+1 as

    X+iY = b^e0 + i * b^e1 + i^2 * b^e2 + ... + i^t * b^et

Each 2^ek has become b^ek base b=i+1.  The i^k is an extra factor i at each
1 bit of N, causing a rotation by +90 degrees for the bits above it.  Notice
the factor is i^k not i^ek, ie. it increments only with the 1-bits of N, not
the whole exponent.

A single bit N=2^k is the simplest and is X+iY=(i+1)^k.  These
N=1,2,4,8,16,etc are at successive angles 45, 90, 135, etc degrees (the same
as in ComplexPlus).  But points N=2^k+1 with two bits means X+iY=(i+1) +
i*(i+1)^k and that factor "i*" is a rotation by 90 degrees so points
N=3,5,9,17,33,etc are in the next quadrant around from their preceding
2,4,8,16,32.

As per the exercise in Knuth it's reasonably easy to show that this
calculation is a one-to-one mapping between integer N and complex integer
X+iY, so the path covers the plane and visits all points once each.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::ComplexRevolving-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new path object.

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.  Points begin
at 0 and if C<$n E<lt> 0> then the return is an empty list.
