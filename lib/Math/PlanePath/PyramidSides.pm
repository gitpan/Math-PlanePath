=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::PyramidSides -- points along the sides of pyramid

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::PyramidSides;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::PyramidSides->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path puts points in layers along the sides of a pyramid growing
upwards.

            18  11   6   3   8  15  24            1

                         ^
    ... -4  -3  -2  -1  X=0  1   2   3   4 ...

X<Square numbers>N=1,4,9,16,etc along the positive X axis is the perfect
squares.  N=2,6,12,20,etc in the X=-1 vertical is the
X<Pronic numbers>pronic numbers k*(k+1) half way between those successive
squares.

The pattern is the same as the C<Corner> path but turned and spread so the
single quadrant in the C<Corner> becomes a half-plane here.

The pattern is similar to C<PyramidRows> (with its default step=2), just
with the columns dropped down vertically to start at the X axis.  Any
pattern occurring within a column is unchanged, but what was a row becomes a
diagonal and vice versa.

=head2 Lucky Numbers of Euler

An interesting sequence for this path is Euler's k^2+k+41.  The low values
are spread around a bit, but from N=1763 (k=41) they're the vertical at
X=40.  There's quite a few primes in this quadratic and when plotting primes
that vertical stands out a little denser than its surrounds (at least for up
to the first 2500 or so values).  The line shows in other step==2 paths too,
but not as clearly.  In the C<PyramidRows> for instance the beginning is up
at Y=40, and in the C<Corner> path it's a diagonal.

=head2 N Start

The default is to number points starting N=1 as shown above.  An optional
C<n_start> can give a different start, in the same pyramid pattern.  For
example to start at 0,

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::PyramidSides-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::PyramidSides-E<gt>new (n_start =E<gt> $n)>

Create and return a new path object.

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.

For C<$n < 0.5> the return is an empty list, it being considered there are no
negative points in the pyramid.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>xy_to_n ($x,$y)>

Return the point number for coordinates C<$x,$y>.  C<$x> and C<$y> are
each rounded to the nearest integer which has the effect of treating points
in the pyramid as a squares of side 1, so the half-plane y>=-0.5 is entirely
covered.

=item C<($n_lo, $n_hi) = $path-E<gt>rect_to_n_range ($x1,$y1, $x2,$y2)>

The returned range is exact, meaning C<$n_lo> and C<$n_hi> are the smallest
and biggest in the rectangle.

=back

=head1 FORMULAS

=head2 Rectangle to N Range

For C<rect_to_n_range()>, in each column N increases so the biggest N is in
the topmost row and and smallest N in the bottom row.

In each row N increases along the sequence X=0,-1,1,-2,2,-3,3, etc.  So the
biggest N is at the X of biggest absolute value and preferring the positive
X=k over the negative X=-k.

The smallest N conversely is at the X of smallest absolute value.  If the X
range crosses 0, ie. C<$x1> and C<$x2> have different signs, then X=0 is the
smallest.
