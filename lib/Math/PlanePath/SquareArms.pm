=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::SquareArms -- four spiral arms

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::SquareArms;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::SquareArms->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<In progress ...>

This path follows four spiral arms, each advancing successively,

                ...--33--29                 3
                          |
     26--22--18--14--10  25                 2
      |               |   |
     30  11-- 7-- 3   6  21                 1
      |   |           |   |
    ...  15   4   1   2  17  ...        <- Y=0
          |   |   |       |   |
         19   8   5-- 9--13  32            -1
          |   |               |
         23  12--16--20--24--28            -2
          |
         27--31--...                       -3

      ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^   ^ 
     -3  -2  -1  X=0  1   2   3 ...

Each arm is quadratic, with each loop 128 longer than the preceding.  The
perfect squares fall in eight straight lines 4, with the even squares on the
X and Y axes and the odd squares on the diagonals X=Y and X=-Y.

Some novel straight lines arise from numbers which are a repdigit in one or
more bases (Sloane's A167782).  "111" in various bases falls on straight
lines.  Numbers "[16][16][16]" in bases 17,19,21,etc are a horizontal at Y=3
because they're perfect squares, and "[64][64][64]" in base 65,66,etc go a
vertically downwards from X=12,Y=-266 similarly because they're squares.

Each arm is N=4*k+rem for a remainder rem=0,1,2,3, so sequences related to
multiples of 4 or with a modulo 4 pattern may fall on particular arms.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::SquareArms-E<gt>new ()>

Create and return a new square spiral object.

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.  For C<$n
E<lt> 1> the return is an empty list, as the path starts at 1.

Fractional C<$n> gives a point on the line between C<$n> and C<$n+4>, that
C<$n+4> being the next point on the same spiralling arm.  This is probably
of limited use, but arises fairly naturally from the calculation.

=head2 FORMULAS

=head2 Rectangle N Range

Within a square X=-d...+d, and Y=-d...+d the biggest N is the end of the N=5
arm in that square, which is N=9, 25, 49, 81, etc, (2d+1)^2, in successive
corners of the square.  So for a rectangle find a surrounding d square,

    d = max(abs(x1),abs(y1),abs(x2),abs(y2))

from which

    Nmax = (2*d+1)^2
         = (4*d + 4)*d + 1

This can be used for a minimum too by finding the smallest d covered by the
rectangle.

    dlo = max (0,
               min(abs(y1),abs(y2)) if x=0 not covered
               min(abs(x1),abs(x2)) if y=0 not covered
              )

from which the maximum of the preceding dlo-1 square,

    Nlo = /  1 if dlo=0
          \  (2*(dlo-1)+1)^2 +1  if dlo!=0
              = (2*dlo - 1)^2
              = (4*dlo - 4)*dlo + 1

For a tighter maximum, horizontally N increases to the left or right of the
diagonal X=Y line (or X=Y+/-1 line), which means one end or the other is the
maximum.  Similar vertically N increases above or below the off-diagonal
X=-Y so the top or bottom is the maximum.  This means for a rectangle the
biggest N is at one of the four corners,

    Nhi = max (xy_to_n (x1,y1),
               xy_to_n (x1,y2),
               xy_to_n (x2,y1),
               xy_to_n (x2,y2))

The current code uses a dlo for Nlo and the corners for Nhi, which means the
high is exact but the low is not.
