=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path visits integer points X,Y in order of their distance from the
origin 0,0, or anti-clockwise from the X axis among those of equal distance,

For example N=58 is at X=4,Y=-1 is sqrt(4*4+1*1) = sqrt(17) from the origin.
The next furthest from the origin is X=3,Y=3 at sqrt(18).

See TriangularHypot for points in order of X^2+3*Y^2, or DiamondSpiral and
PyrmaidSides in order of plain sum X+Y.

=head2 Equal Distances

Points with the same distance are taken in anti-clockwise order around from
the X axis.  For example X=3,Y=1 is sqrt(10) from the origin, as are the
swapped X=1,Y=3, and X=-1,Y=3 etc in other quadrants, for a total 8 points
N=30 to N=37 all the same distance.

When one of X or Y is 0 there's no negative, so just four negations like
N=10 to 13 points X=2,Y=0 through X=0,Y=-2.  Or on the diagonal X==Y there's
no swap, so just four like N=22 to N=25 points X=3,Y=3 through X=3,Y=-3.

There can be more than one way for the same distance to arise.
A Pythagorean triple like 3^2 + 4^2 == 5^2 has 8 points from the 3,4, then 4
points from the 5,0 giving a total 12 points N=70 to N=81.  Other
combinations like 20^2 + 15^2 == 24^2 + 7^2 occur too, and also with more
than two different ways to have the same sum.

=head2 Multiples of 4

The first point of a given distance from the origin is either on the X axis
or somewhere in the first octant.  The row Y=1 just above the axis is the
first of its equals from XE<gt>=2 onwards, and similarly further rows for
big enough X.

There's always a multiple of 4 many points with the same distance so the
first point has N=4*k+2, and similarly on the negative X side N=4*j, for
some k or j.  If you plot the prime numbers on the path then those even N's
(composites) are gaps just above the positive X axis, and on or just below
the negative X axis.

=head2 Circle Lattice

Gauss's circle lattice problem asks how many integer X,Y points there are
within a circle of radius R.

The points on the X axis N=2,10,26,46, etc are the first for which
X^2+Y^2==R^2 (integer X==R).  Adding option C<n_start=E<gt>0> to make them
each 1 less gives the number of points strictly inside, ie. X^2+Y^2 E<lt>
R^2.

The last point satisfying X^2+Y^2==R^2 is either in the octant below the X
axis, or is on the negative Y axis.  Those N's are the number of points
X^2+Y^2E<lt>=R^2, Sloane's A000328.

When that A000328 sequence is plotted on the path a straight line can be
seen in the fourth quadrant extending down just above the diagonal.  It
arises from multiples of the Pythagorean 3^2 + 4^2, first X=4,Y=-3, then
X=8,Y=-6, etc X=4*k,Y=-3*k.  But sometimes the multiple is not the last
among those of that 5*k radius, so there's gaps in the line.  For example
20,-15 is not the last since because 24,-7 is also 25 away from the origin.

=head2 Even Points

Option C<points =E<gt> "even"> visits just the even points, meaning the sum
X+Y even, so X,Y both even or both odd.

Even points can be mapped to all points by a 45 degree rotate and flip.
N=1,6,22,etc on the X axis here is on the X=Y diagonal of all-points.  And
conversely N=1,2,10,26,etc on the X=Y diagonal here is the X axis of
all-points.

The sets of points with equal hypotenuse are the same in the even and all,
but the flip takes them in a reversed order.

=head2 Odd Points

Option C<points =E<gt> "odd"> visits just the odd points, meaning sum X+Y
odd, so X,Y one odd the other even.

Odd points can be mapped to all points by a 45 degree rotate and a shift
X-1,Y+1 to put N=1 at the origin.  The effect of that shift is as if the
hypot measure in "all" points was (X-1/2)^2+(Y-1/2)^2 and for that reason
the sets of points with equal hypots are not the same in odd and all.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Math::PlanePath/FUNCTIONS> for behaviour common to all path classes.

=over 4

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::Hypot-E<gt>new ()>

=item C<$path = Math::PlanePath::Hypot-E<gt>new (points =E<gt> $str), n_start =E<gt> $n>

Create and return a new hypot path object.  The C<points> option can be

    "all"         all integer X,Y (the default)
    "even"        only points with X+Y even
    "odd"         only points with X+Y odd

=item C<($x,$y) = $path-E<gt>n_to_xy ($n)>

Return the X,Y coordinates of point number C<$n> on the path.

For C<$n E<lt> 1> the return is an empty list, it being considered the first
point at X=0,Y=0 is N=1.

Currently it's unspecified what happens if C<$n> is not an integer.
Successive points are a fair way apart, so it may not make much sense to say
give an X,Y position in between the integer C<$n>.

=item C<$n = $path-E<gt>xy_to_n ($x,$y)>

Return an integer point number for coordinates C<$x,$y>.  Each integer N is
considered the centre of a unit square and an C<$x,$y> within that square
returns N.

For "even" and "odd" options only every second square in the plane has an N
and if C<$x,$y> is a position not covered then the return is C<undef>.

=head1 FORMULAS

The calculations are not particularly efficient currently.  Private arrays
are built similar to what's described for HypotOctant, but with replication
for negative and swapped X,Y.

=head1 OEIS

Entries in Sloane's Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences related to
this path include

    http://oeis.org/A051132  (etc)

    points="all", n_start=0
      A051132    N on X axis, being count points norm < X^2

    points="odd"
      A005883    count of points with norm==4*n+1
